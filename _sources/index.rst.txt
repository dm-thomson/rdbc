Rate-Dependent Behaviour of Composites (RDBC)
=============================================

This site contains interactive versions of the scatter plots presented in the article titled
`"A review of the effect of loading rate on the mechanical properties of unidirectional carbon fibre reinforced polymer composites" <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2025.108773>`_
, published in Composites: Part A, which can also be found in the `RDBC GitHub repository <https://github.com/dm-thomson/rdbc>`_
along with the `rdbc_data.csv <https://github.com/dm-thomson/rdbc/blob/main/rdbc_data.csv>`_ file containing the full set of data collected from the literature.
